# Tux Racing - Chemistry
---

This is a demonstration module to show how to implement a test-bank-based problem generator exposing the standard Tux Racing lesson interface. It is currently un-tested and sparsely documented, but serves it's purpose

The test-bank is stored in human-readable YAML files under lessons/. Currently there are only two lessons with a handful of questions each, again this is meant as a demonstration module.
